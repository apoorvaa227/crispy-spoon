            <p class="description"> 
                She spent her childhood in exile, impoverished, living on dreams and schemes, running from one city to the next, always fearful, never safe, friendless but for a brother who was by all accounts half-mad... a brother who sold her maidenhood to the Dothraki for the promise of an army. Somewhere upon the grass, her dragons hatched, and so did she. She is proud. How not? What else was left her but pride? She is strong. How not? The Dothraki despise weakness. If Daenerys had been weak, she would have perished with Viserys. She is fierce. Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen are proof enough of that. She has survived assassins and conspiracies and fell sorceries, grieved for a brother and a husband and a son, trod the cities of the slavers to dust beneath her dainty sandaled feet.
